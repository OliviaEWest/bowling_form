# bowling_form
This repository contains sample HTML5 markup for the bowling alley reservation form. 

The form has three pages/steps.

1. Date picker element to select the day for which the user would like to reserve a bowling lane.
2. A table containing a list of available times for the two bowling lanes.
  * Free times are denoted with the "open" CSS class and will have a radio input for selecting the time.
  * Reserved times will have the "reserved" CSS class and instead of the radio input, will display the name of the group which reserved it.
3. The last page is a simple confirmation page that confirms whether the reservation was successful or reports any errors that occurred.

Only the bowling form needs to be styled as the remainder of the page elements have already been styled as desired.

You will the bowling form markup will begin and end with HTML comments `<!-- that look like this -->`. 

All CSS should go into the `bowl.css` stylesheet.
