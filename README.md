# bowling_form
This repository contains sample HTML5 markup for the bowling alley reservation form. 

The form follow the wireframe/mock-up presented by CBK, and consists of 4 "steps" on one page.

1. The form can be included in an existing page as-is and the included script will work fine. If the form markup is not used, the javascript file will need to be updated to fit your existing markup. The form can be found between the HTML comments `<!-- that look like this -->`.
